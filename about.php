    <p>Some people choose their career and for few their career chooses them, latter happened with me and it happened the day when I used my dad’s pantex k1000 for the first time, and that's how my journey behind the camera started. The passion increased with every step and turn my life took, and with every piece of equipment I got, just like when my neighbour Mrs Lalita gifted me an old projector with some black and white reels, I got so fascinated that I used to pause and admire the effort how every scene was shot and how it was created, from that moment I fell in love with the process of "Film Making". Every person has a different view the way he or she looks at life and art, for me Movie making became both.</p>

  <p>Today when I look at all the work I have done I feel I could have done better as a filmmaker be it a music video, documentary or a wedding because every video contains those priceless emotions and memory, the effort of the person behind and in front of the camera and that's what is my driving force, this is what I breathe and live on regardless of the medium.</p>

  <p>For me my team it’s not JUST A JOB, may sound cliché but for us its an ART, for us its leaving a piece of history that you can cherish and admire every time you see it, because lets be honest all the effort and work of different people like the time and effort invested in scouting for location, makeup, jewellery the venue the dress the food all is covered by only one medium, through the humble 'Camera' and you relive those moments through our vision.</p>
